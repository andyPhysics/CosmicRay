Analysis of CosmicRay Composition

Key Aspects of my Code

Check-fit.ipynb contains code that I used to review the fits and transformations for events 

The bulk of my code is in NN where NN_fitter produces the neural network, decision tree, and plots to ensure that the model is working

We are looking to predict Xmax for composition analysis by extracting new variables shown in Check-fit.ipynb by fitting a function to thickness parameters and Laputop curvature parameters to improve resolution.
