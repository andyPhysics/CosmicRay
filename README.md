Analysis of CosmicRay Composition
Author: Andres Medina
Institution: The Ohio State University

This code takes works with simulation data found in the following directory:
/data/user/amedina/CosmicRay

You will find the following directories:
Analysis -- I3files and root files with curvature and thickness fit
Analysis_data -- I3files and root files with curvature and thickness fit for experimental data
csv_files -- csv files containing all the necessary information for training networks
csv_files_data -- csv files containing all the necessary information for the experimental data
I3_files -- I3files that only contains coincident events, these are the files that are use to calculate the curvature and thickness. Contains also waveforms
I3_files_data -- I3files that only contains coincident events, these are the files that are used to calculate curvature and thickness for experimentald data. Contains waveforms and is a 10\% cut.
